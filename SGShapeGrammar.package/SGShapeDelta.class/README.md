I am the relative change (delta) between two shapes.

I store information about what changed between two shapes.
Regarding the geometry 5 things can happen:

1) Remove a SGVector
2) Remove a SGLine
3) Add a SGVector
4) Add a SGLine
5) Translate an existing SGVector

regarding labels similiar things can happen.
