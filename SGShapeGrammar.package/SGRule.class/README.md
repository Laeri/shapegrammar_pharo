I represent a rule in a Shape Grammar.

I know how shapes are transformed (alpha --> beta) and what happens in this transformation (which 
lines are removed/added, which points are removed/added in which points are only moved around).
I can also find subshapes inside other shapes and calculate the SGShapeDelta when the rule would
be applied onto a shape.
