I am used to label coordinates in 2D.

I am not part of the geometry of SGShape which will be drawn but I can be used to mark certain
positions in 2D. This can help to define orientations to restrict SGRule. I have to be matched only
with other LabelPoints and this matching will restrict the orientations of the subshape to be found.

I am not yet implemented and used either by the interpreter or the editor!!!
